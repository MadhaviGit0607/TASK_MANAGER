Node.js: You can download it from here.
npm (Node Package Manager): This is installed along with Node.js.
Verify installation by running:
bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
Replace your-username with the actual username of your GitHub account.

2. Navigate to Project Directory
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd task-manager
3. Install Dependencies
To install all the required dependencies, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install all the packages listed in the package.json file.

4. Run the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using the following command:

This will start the React app and open it in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

5. Build the Project for Production (Optional)
To create an optimized production build, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This will create a build folder with all the minified files that you can deploy to your server.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

bash
Copy code
/task-manager
  /public
    index.html            # Main HTML file
  /src
    /components
      AddTaskForm.js       # Component for adding tasks
      EditTaskModal.js     # Component for editing tasks
      TaskList.js          # Component for displaying task list
    App.js                 # Main App component
    index.js               # Entry point of the React app
    /styles

Features
Add Task: A form to add a task with title, description, due date, and status.
View Tasks: Display tasks in a list format (cards or table) with details like title, description, due date, and status.
Edit Task: Inline or modal-based editing of tasks.
Delete Task: Ability to delete a task with a confirmation prompt.
Data Persistence: Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, so they persist across sessions.
Sorting and Filtering (Optional): Sort tasks by due date or filter them by status.
Customizing and Enhancing the Project
State Management: The app uses React's useState for managing tasks. For advanced state management, you can refactor the app to use Context API or Redux.
Styling: This project uses plain CSS (or Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS) for styling. You can customize the styles as per your preference.
Filters and Sorting: You can enhance the project by adding additional filters (e.g., by due date or status) or sorting the tasks by their due date.
